# Tackling Hate Speech Hatemoji with Machine Learning

## Introduction

This project is a prototype of a Hate Speech Detection Systems in a research project, by incorporating emojis into the dataset to train the BERT model, put into consideration of the emojis and obfuscations to implement a more modern hate speech detection systems, which ultimately contribute to the society.

By running bert.py, it would build a model with the pre-selected datset (labeled_data_added_emoji.csv) which was based on a benchmark dataset from previous researchers.

You can use the environmental.yml to config your conda environment. In this case, WSL Ubuntu was used to utilise the GPUs to build the model.
